## This notebook does the following

* Retrieves BigQuery Public Dataset - San Francisco Film Locations<br>
* Extract the data, make SQL queries to answer questions on the film locations dataset<br>
* Visualize the query results of the dataset

## Using Python and BigQuery (SQL) to analyze films shot in San Francisco

Google BigQuery has many interesting public datasets including **SF Film Locations**<br>
maintained by the San Francisco Film Commission<br>

https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?filter=solution-type:dataset&q=name&id=a19b0f22-c4bc-4f19-87ec-5ae4e6bee957&subtask=details&subtaskValue=san-francisco-public-data%2Fsf-film-locations&project=twitteranalysis-255507&authuser=1&folder&subtaskIndex=7

I have decided to use the public dataset for my BigQuery project to answer the questions I had with the dataset<br>
with the steps below:

1. **Data Loading** - getting the dataset from BigQuery Public Dataset
2. **Data Wrangling** - getting the data ready for analysis and answer the questions
3. **Data Manipulation** - I answered the questions I had 
4. **Data Visualization** - to visually present the results and answers to my questions
